This skim looks for events in which a proton, K+, and K- are detected. I do need to make an updated skim for when there is a missing K- which I will be working on soon. Only Lorentz invariants and lab frame quantities are given by this skim. Everything is given so you can modify it.

Things that need to be changed before using:

1) In makeStubs.pl, line 4, change the output directory (outdir1) to where you want the files to be stored. Inside that directory, you must create subdirectories bos/, view/, logs/.

2)On line 5, change work directory (workdir) to your work directory and store the farm directory given in the work directory. If you name "farm" something else or add a subdirectory or any modifications of it, lines 50 and 51 must be changed accordingly.


To run: 	perl makeStubs.pl (after modifications)
			perl jsub.pl [# of jobs to run]
