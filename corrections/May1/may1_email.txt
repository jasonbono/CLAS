1)

Hi all,
I have attached a tar file which includes MK's beam energy correction and
my latest momentum corrections. I have also included a stand-alone program
and a script used to compile and run it. The script "run_test.sh" is shown
below. The example program itself is equally simple. Enjoy!

####################################
#!/bin/sh

echo "compiling example program..."
g++ -o example example.cpp

echo "running example program..."
./example
###################################


2) later that day

there was an undeclared variable i took out in this one so it should
compile fine now....
