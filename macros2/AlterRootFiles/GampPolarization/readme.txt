This is the code has no real purpose, it was written to develop the the final 'analyzer' which takes in a gamp/ascii file and spits out a gamp/ascii file but with a polarization.
Find this code in the analyzer directory.  this code should work well, but it serves no purpose for the sake of analysis.


the './cpp' directory contains similar content to '.' the only difference is that is was compiled as a cpp program rather than left as a root macro.
