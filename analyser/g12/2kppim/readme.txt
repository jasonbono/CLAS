the 2kppim-v00 analyzer series was adopted from the v37k analyzer.  the first in the new series will be the same analyzer but cleaned up and possibly with the addition of t,tmin and tprime for kp1.

from 2kppim-v00, the 2kp-v00 analyzer will be able to be made quickly.


CONSIDERATIONS:

want to put in a good cut for the kpkp analyzer to show the Xi... this may be the requirement that the number of K- is zero.  also could inumerate some of the main decays to this channel in order to get a clean signal. for example for the kpkppim channel the magic cut is that the missing particle is the lambda.


the g11photon energy may be incorrect.

how can there be X output statments within an if statment while there are Y output statments within the corresponding else statemnt (for X not equal to Y) without causing a labling discrepancy???
